    "Caesar Cipher is named after Roman general Gaius Julius Caesar. It is the easiest cipher technique you have played around as a kid without knowing its name. You substitute each letter with a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For instance, when the shift is 2, a->c, b->d, c->e, \"je sais pas\"->\"lg ucku rcu\". The cipher can be easily cracked by letter frequency analysis as long as you know what the underlying language is."

As in natural languages, words show various statistical regularities, that's why we can use deep learning to predict the next possible word. The decryption can be tackled by letter frequency analysis. In our case, we only consider 26 English letters. The frequency analysis can be done on single letter or multiple letters (N-gram model). The result is always arbitrary. The most frequent letter in this ciphertext may not be the one across all English literatures depending on the sample size. If you are not short of computing power and manpower, you can always use brute force to try all possibilities for Caesar cipher."
