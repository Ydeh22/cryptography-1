# Cryptography

I have always been fascinated by cryptography. Most people start coding because they want to hack into someone’s bank account and become a millionaire to retire on some tropical islands. So do I :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: Well, if you want to learn hacking, cryptography and network security is a must (although for real hackers, psychology and phishing are more important). Hence, I decided to create some ciphers just for fun. Unlike other popular repositories, currently I have no plan to maintain this one. Who knows :smirk: Maybe this repository may get as popular as the rest of mine or I actually get drawn into number theory. We will see :sunglasses:
